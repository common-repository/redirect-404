Automatically detects and redirects 404 errors to a static 404.php page using .htaccess

== Description ==
= Automatically Redirect 404 Errors =

This plugin automatically detects 404 errors on your Wordpress website and inserts lines in your .htaccess to redirect them to a static 404 page. The plugin then emails administrators about the detected 404 errors.

This will prevent Wordpress from being triggered every time a page is not found which will conserve valuable server resources.

In turn this also alerts website owners to SEO issues and hack attempts.

We plan to develop this plugin further to allow editing 404 redirected URLs to point to an existing page via 301 redirect via the settings page. Also in the pipeline is cloud blocking of suspicious IP ranges.

If this is something you would like to be seen developed, please contact us.
